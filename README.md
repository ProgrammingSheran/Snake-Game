# Snake-Game
Snake-Game written in Processing\
I always work on this project when I want to.\
Don't know when it's done (working) ??!\
I mean it works so far:\
\
--> Character movement\
--> Random spawning of enemies\
\
What I'll try to do in the future:\
--> Increasing snakes length whenever you "eat" an enemy. (collision detection involved)\
--> Game score in the game window, increases whenever you "eat" an enemy.\
--> Random movement of the enemies in the game.
\
\
Guess that's it. Guess it won't be more.\
(This is by the way the longest README I've ever written!) :-)
